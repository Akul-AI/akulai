# AkulAI

If you want a more stable version (this is not done yet and may not work) head [here](https://github.com/Akul-AI/akulai/tree/master-v1)

## Installation

### Manual installation

First of all, download the ASR model from [here](https://alphacephei.com/vosk/models), unzip it, rename it to `vosk_model` and place it inside `models` folder, which is located in the `akulai` directory. Make sure that you have Node.js and any installation of Perl installed, and make sure cpamn (Perl's package manager) is in the system PATH for Windows.

### Automatic installation (with script)

Again, you may either follow the steps above, or you may use the provided python script. We have also provided a Batch (Windows CMD) and Bash (Shell) script. If you face any errors, however, please use the python script before reporting it.

Keep in mind that:
 - All the scripts assume you have a working installation of Python installed.

## How do I create a skill...??

Check the `create_plugins.md` file, located in the `docs` folder. We now support JS and Perl plugins too! (To share your plugins, see the [akulai plugins](https://github.com/Akul-AI/akulai-plugins) repository.)

## What happened to the other version?

Go to the [master-v1 branch](https://github.com/Akul-AI/akulai/tree/master-v1) for the code. If you did see this code when it was being developed, thank you for supporting us for so long!

## Contribution

You can look at the `todo.md` file (not always updated) or you can look at the issues. Make sure to check the CONTRIBUTING.md guide before making a new feature/fix, though. Thanks to all the contributors!

## Pointless Information (Kinda)

We use semantic versioning. That's it so far.

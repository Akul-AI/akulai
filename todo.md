# Near future
 - [ ] Implement NLP
 - [ ] Optimize current code for fastest speed
 - [ ] Gain a bigger community lol
 - [ ] Split code into smaller files for easier maintenance
 - [ ] Get an intent parser up and running rather than going through each plugin for every command

# Later
 - [ ] Add plugin support for more languages (Ruby, Go, and Java - eventually)
 - [ ] Have a mobile app for AkulAI (probably in React or Flutter so we can use same codebase for multiple platforms)
 - [ ] Have a website with regular updates and everything
 
# Done
None yet (sadly).
